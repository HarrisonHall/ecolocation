## Inspiration

Pokemon is an insanely popular app worldwide that allows players to catch pokemon and battle each other. We applied this model to helping the earth, by allowing people to organize clean up events and encourage others to attend. The incentive for attending one of these Earth-saving events is to tag a new bat of varying rarity. Will you and your bat buddies be able to save the earth?

## What it does

This is a platform that allows users to create events that help the earth, such as Trash pickup, recycling events, and climate change marches and walks. Users that go to these events will have a random chance of tagging certain bats, some being harder to tag than others. The competition and urge to "collect 'em all" are the main motivators for playing.

## How we built it

We built this app from scratch using the python framework, Django, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the Google maps api. The site ended up being hosted and deployed on Heroku.

## Challenges we ran into

Hosting and deployment were the biggest challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to create a deployed database that holds users and displays information on the events they go to and the bats they hold. It is easily navigable and works splendidly on mobile.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about Bats, the environment, Django, and web development and deployment.

## What's next for Ecolocation

Gen 2 (Whales), adding more bats to gen 1, improving the ui, and getting a proper domain name. We also want to add features to make bats and environmental events more interactive.
